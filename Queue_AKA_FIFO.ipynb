        "As you already know, a stack is a data structure realizing the so-called LIFO (Last In - First Out) model. It's easy and you've already grown perfectly accustomed to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's taste something new now. A queue is a data model characterized by the term FIFO: First In - Fist Out. Note: a regular queue (line) you know from shops or post offices works exactly in the same way - a customer who came first is served first too.\n",

        "Your task is to implement the Queue class with two basic operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "put(element), which puts an element at end of the queue;\n",
        "get(), which takes an element from the front of the queue and returns it as the result (the queue cannot be empty to successfully perform it.)\n",
        "Follow the hints:\n",
        "\n",
        "use a list as your storage (just like we did in stack)\n",
        "put() should append elements to the beginning of the list, while get() should remove the elements from the list's end;\n",
