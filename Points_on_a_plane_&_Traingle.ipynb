        "\n",
        "Each point located on the plane can be described as a pair of coordinates customarily called x and y. We expect that you are able to write a Python class which stores both coordinates as float numbers. Moreover, we want the objects of this class to evaluate the distances between any of the two points situated on the plane.\n",

        "The task is rather easy if you employ the function named hypot() (available through the math module) which evaluates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle (more details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotenuse) and here: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/math.html#trigonometric-functions.\n",
