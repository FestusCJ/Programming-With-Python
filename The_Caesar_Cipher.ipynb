        "\n",
        "The first problem we want to show you is called the Caesar cipher - more details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher.\n",
        "\n",
        "This cipher was (probably) invented and used by Gaius Julius Caesar and his troops during the Gallic Wars. The idea is rather simple - every letter of the message is replaced by its nearest consequent (A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on). The only exception is Z, which becomes A.\n",

        "line 05: if the current character is not alphabetic...\n",
        "line 06: ...ignore it;\n",
        "line 07: convert the letter to upper-case (it's preferable to do it blindly, rather than check whether it's needed or not)\n",
        "line 08: get the code of the letter and increment it by one;\n",
        "line 09: if the resulting code has \"left\" the Latin alphabet (if it's greater than the Z code)...\n",
