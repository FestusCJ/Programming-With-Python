        "\n",
        "objects of the class should be \"printable\", i.e. they should be able to implicitly convert themselves into strings of the same form as the constructor arguments;\n",
        "the class should be equipped with one-parameter methods called add_days(n) and subtract_days(n), with n being an integer number and updating the day of week stored inside the object in the way reflecting the change of date by the indicated number of days, forward or backward.\n",
